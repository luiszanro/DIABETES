# Diabetes Project

Repository for a Data Science Project "DIABETES" 

## Version

This information is for version 0.1. It was created taking in consideration an specific dataset [the DataSet was obtained from       which is free to use]

## Getting started

DIABETES can be called in two modes: Binary(0 and 1)), or States (1, 2, 3).

## Binary Mode:

Edit the filepaths (if necessary) and run the script: 

```
cd Diabetes
# Adapt paths and filenames of input data
vi main.py 
python main.py
```

## SDC mode :

This mode still is work in progress.
